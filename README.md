# Zen dashboard, built in Next.js

This is a dashboard project I created from the Next.js 14 tutorial (https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app). The idea here was to learn the framework by applying the principles to project of a different name, so that the concepts would stick better.

## Project name: Zen Dashboard Project start date: 04/06/2024

### Goals:

- Landing page
- Dashboard data fetching
- Authentication
- Search and pagination
- One custom feature (dark mode, additional feature, styling etc)

## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

This is a dashboard project I created from the Next.js 14 tutorial (https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app). The idea here was to learn the framework by applying the principles to project of a different name, so that the concepts would stick better.

Project name: Zen Dashboard Project start date: 04/06/2024

Goals:

Build a dashboard using the NExt 14 dashboard app course
Learn Next 14 enough to implement one custom feature not taught in the course
